                    <p>Social Media is a platform over 2.65 Billion users use on a daily basis. Users are able to share their daily lives, photos, information and news. With Social media giving communication methods to millions of people it is allowing us
                        to build a more connective society.</p>

                        <h2>What is the Issue and Why is this an Issue?</h2>
                    </header>
                    <p>In our society, fake news has become a large issue and social media is a large contributor to the spreading of misinformation. This is because users not validating information before sharing due to the difficulty of validation. Along
                        with this, many sites have misinformation on the trending tab and have APIs that can allow people to spread misinformation intentionally much easier due to the lack of regulation on APIs.</p>

                    <p>Fake news is a large problem one it's own right and social media is propograting the current flaws. Misinformation threatens democracy as it gives a false perception of what is occurring in the world. A prominent example was during
                        the 2016 election where there was meddling on the facts through social media platforms. Truth needs to be given to public and developing policies on social media can ensure that public will make steps toward a world without misinformation.

                <h2>How can we Solve this?</h2>
            </header>
            <p>The Solution is Stiffer Regulation on Trending Information and Reduced API access</p>
            <div class="row gtr-150">
                <div class="col-6 col-12-medium">
                    <span class="image fit"><img src="misinformation.jpg" alt="" /></span>
                    <h3>What Should we Do in Regard of Legislation?</h3>
                    <p>Singapore has recently passed a law that would look at trending information and force platforms to audit and correct misinformation after issues in their previous election scandal. Censorship is a large issue when it comes to regulating
                        social media platforms so their solution focused on monitoring the top trending information and correcting it with the information provided by the official Singaporian information source.</p>

                <div class="col-6 col-12-medium">
                    <span class="image fit"><img src="misinformation_media.jpeg" alt="" /></span>
                    <h3>Why is this the Best Legislation Solution?</h3>
                    <p>What singapore did well in their legislation was targetting issues on a large scale while not massively restricting freedom of speech. They acknowledge that misinformation will still be prevalent but they will be able to reduce the
                        information that is trending and hitting the larger public. Solutions like this avoid issues regarding freedom of speech as it is correcting misinformation on a large scale.</p>

                        <h3>What is an API and how can we regulate fake news?</h3>
                        <p>An API is better known as Application Program Interfaces are open source code segments that developers can use to build products with server authentication. Most API's are developed by large corporations so developers are able
                            to use their platforms to build new products. Most social media platforms offer starter code to make bots with ease on platforms while ultimately leads to large amounts of bots on various different platforms. Bots are a large
                            contributing factor in the spreading of misinformation as they are able to spread information easily without user authentication.</p>

                        <h3>Why is this the best Solution?</h3>
                        <p>It's important to give developers data analytics tools and opportunities to make new products however restricting solely the automated responses can allow for a safer platform. Twitter recently developed new API restrictions that
                            prevent completely autonomous bots by setting an API limit. After the implementation of these new rules, the platform experienced much less bots and more usage in their data analytics API. Other platforms have not set a rule
                            like this but setting this standard to all platforms can reduce the misinformation spread.</p>
